# Meteor Demo

This is a presentable Meteor Demo requiring a terminal, Vim, ultisnips, and a
browser.

There are six steps:

0.  Intro
1.  Quick start!
2.  Reactive programming with templates and sessions
3.  Review and refactor
4.  Collections and data
5.  Security

You can quickly step through the steps with `git checkout -f step#`

Or you can interact with the audience using Vim + ultisnips.
